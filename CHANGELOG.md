# Changelog

## 2.1.0

### General

* The copyright statement on all source code files has been updated.
* A bug affecting file watches on non-macOS platforms has been identified and fixed. The issue was caused by an erroneous generic cast unintentionally converting the watched path from the internal path type to a type alias of the same name that was exported from another file.
* Log messages from the GraalVM Polyglot engine emitted when the Konf JavaScript interpreter is not running on a GraalVM JDK have now been suppressed.
* A bug affecting YAML writer output for strings that contain `:` has been identified and fixed.
* As promised in the release notes for version 2.0.2, the Java requirement has been reduced from JDK 21 to JDK 11.
  * The only part of the project that still requires JDK 21 is the Maven Central publishing plugin for Gradle.
  * All other build phases in Gradle, and the Konf runtime, are able to run on any version of the JDK 11+.

	* SLF4J Simple: 2.0.12 -> 2.0.13

### Tests

* All tests have been completely rewritten to use standard JUnit Jupiter with Kotlin test assertions instead of the unmaintained JetBrains Spek engine and Hamkrest assertions.
* All test classes have been reorganized to separate "helper" classes that are only used by tests from the actual tests.
* Line separators now use macOS/Linux style on all platforms to avoid test failures on Windows due to inconsistent behavior between the different configuration language parsers and writers.
* As a side effect of the JUnit conversion, test execution is now fully parallelized and takes significantly less time to complete than the previous Spek-based tests.
* Test coverage has been improved from around 50% to 90%, as Kover was missing a significant number of tested lines of code run by the Spek engine.
* Several minor and/or platform-specific bugs discovered during test conversion have been fixed.
* The coverage report no longer erroneously includes content from the `benchmark` and `snippet` source sets.
* All test utilities are now documented correctly.

## 2.0.2/2.0.3

* This is the first "official" release that has a fully working build system that's nearly identical to the system provided by the original library. It features working benchmarks, tests, and valid documentation and source code JARs.
* No major code changes have been made to the library; as long as you meet the requirements, existing Konf code should work after migrating the `com.uchuhimo.konf` namespace to `io.github.nhubbard.konf`. However, there are some changes made to dependencies and the environment.
* The Konf source code must be built with JDK 21 to work with the publishing plugin we use. It does not require JDK 21 to use once built.
* The new runtime JDK target is 17, at least for now. That makes it target Android 14 (API 34) or higher. I am considering dropping it to Java 11 to allow for greater compatibility with more Android and JDK installations.
* We now use all the most up-to-date versions of our dependencies. That means Kotlin 1.9.22, Gradle 8.6, etc.
* Konf is 100% compatible with Kotlin 2.0 as written; our releases are compiled with the experimental K2 compiler right now.

## 2.0.0

* The entire codebase has been (at least temporarily) de-modularized due to the previous modular structure not working
  correctly after migrating to Gradle 8.0 to support newer versions of Kotlin.
* All "default" providers have had their extension points moved into a subpackage to make the codebase easier to
  maintain.
* The base package is now `io.github.nhubbard.konf` instead of `com.uchuhimo.konf` to ensure a clean separation from the
  unmaintained original Konf framework.

## 0.19.0

Since all sources are substituted before loaded into config by default, all path variables will be substituted now.
You can use `config.disable(Feature.SUBSTITUTE_SOURCE_BEFORE_LOADED)` to disable this change.

## 0.17.0

After the migration to tree-based source APIs, many deprecated APIs have been removed, including:

- `Source`: all `isXXX` and `toXXX` APIs
- `Config`: `layer`, `addSource` and `withSourceFrom`

## 0.15

After modularizing Konf, the `hocon`/`toml`/`xml`/`yaml`/`git`/`watchGit` functions in `DefaultLoaders` have become
extension properties/functions and should be imported explicitly.

For example, you should import `com.nhubbard.konf.source.hocon` before using `config.from.hocon`;
in Java, `config.from().hocon` is unavailable, please use `config.from().source(HoconProvider.INSTANCE)` instead.

If you use JitPack,
you should use `com.github.nhubbard.konf:konf:<version>` instead of `com.github.nhubbard:konf:<version>` now.

## 0.10

APIs in `ConfigSpec` have been updated to support item name's auto-detection.

Here are some examples:

- `val host = optional("host", "0.0.0.0")` to `val host by optional("0.0.0.0")`
- `val port = required<Int>("port")` to `val port by required<Int>()`
- `val nextPort = lazy("nextPort") { config -> config[port] + 1 }` to `val nextPort by lazy { config -> config[port] + 1 }`
